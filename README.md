# Facility Location using Weighted Median

## Description

This project implements a facility location problem using the weighted median method in Python. The goal is to determine the optimal location for a new facility based on the coordinates of existing machines and the number of trips made between them and the new facility.

## Problem Statement

Machines are located at specific coordinates, and each machine has a certain number of trips per week to the new facility. The weighted median method is used to find the best location for the new facility to minimize transportation costs.

### Machine Locations and Trips

- Machine 1: Coordinates (8, 5), Trips: 9
- Machine 2: Coordinates (4, 2), Trips: 6
- Machine 3: Coordinates (11, 8), Trips: 4
- Machine 4: Coordinates (13, 2), Trips: 12

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Clone the Repository


You can clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/facility-location.git
```

### Navigate to the Project Directory

```bash
cd facility-location
```

## Usage

Run the Python script to determine the optimal location for the new facility:

```bash
python facility_location.py
```

## Output

The program will print the coordinates of the new facility based on the weighted median calculation.
